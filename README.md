### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Lucas Gomide, I'm 31 years old and here are a few things about me:

1. When I was just a kid I use to love playing Tibia and **develop scripts** to automate my character movements and progress ðŸ¤« (I know it's not right, I was just a kid though ðŸ˜†)
2. I've got a bachelor's degree in **Architecture & Urbanism**, and I use freelance doing some **3D modeling**
3. I switched my career direction while I was studying **Project Management** at a **continued education program**
4. I became a **Fullstack Software Developer** studying at Trybe.
5. I got my **first job opportunity, also at Trybe**, it was titled as "Student summer Job" and I use to review content and create new exercises to improve the course. **I'll always be greatful for it ðŸ’š**
6. I'm currently working at **DSM-Firmenich** as a Fullstack Software Developer with some **great co-workers and friends** who helped me improve my skills exponentially and again, **I'll always be greatful for the opportunity** ðŸ’š
