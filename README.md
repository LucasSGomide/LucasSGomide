### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Lucas Gomide, 31 years old, and here's a bit about me:

1. As a kid, I loved playing Tibia and even dabbled in **developing scripts** to automate my character's movements (I know, not the best choice, but hey, I was just a kid! ðŸ˜†).
2. I hold a **bachelor's degree in Architecture & Urbanism** and use to freelance in **3D modeling**.
3. My career took a turn while studying **Project Management** in a **continued education program**.
4. I transitioned into a **Fullstack Software Developer** role through my studies at **Trybe**.
5. My **first job opportunity, also at Trybe**, was as a "Student Summer Job" where I **reviewed content and created exercises** to enhance the course. I'll be forever grateful for that experience! ðŸ’š
6. Currently, I'm a **Fullstack Software Developer at DSM-Firmenich**, working alongside **fantastic colleagues and friends** who've significantly boosted my skills. Once again, **immensely grateful for this opportunity**! ðŸ’š
